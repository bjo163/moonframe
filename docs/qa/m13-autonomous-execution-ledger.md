# M13 autonomous execution ledger

Updated 2026-10-26. This ledger records local task execution evidence; it does not certify owner, legal, license, or human visual approval.

## Current counts

- Total task IDs: 488 (460 `MF-VF` + 28 `MF-PF`).
- `MF-PF-003` moved from planned to captured in this invocation. `MF-PF-002` remains pending because it needs an explicit maintainer license/trademark distribution decision; no approval was inferred or recorded.
- Freeze baseline: 14 implemented / 474 pending. Live count after this task: 16 completed-or-captured, 0 blocked, 472 pending (not counting unrecorded external-only blocker state for MF-PF-002).

## MF-PF-001 — Freeze current package/release inventory

- Live HEAD inspected: `affdfe6a56362878b8ca19faab61c922a0264c4b`.
- Scope: `package.json`, `docs/audit/m13-final-reconciliation-2026-10-26.md`, this ledger, and the matching preflight backlog row.
- Inventory: `@moonwitness/moonframe@0.1.1`; `private:false`; `license: MIT`; public publish access; five declared export paths; no standalone `LICENSE` file. Registry status not verified; no publish attempted.
- `node scripts/validate-contracts.mjs` — exit 0.
- `node scripts/verify-m13-handoff.mjs` — exit 0; emitted existing SFX consent/playback and missing LICENSE release warnings.
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` — exit 0; restored the locked workspace dependencies without changing the lockfile.
- `pnpm test` — exit 0; 12/12 unit and SSR tests passed.
- `pnpm run typecheck` — exit 0.
- `pnpm run build` — exit 0; Next.js generated all 88 static/SSG routes.
- Initial runner verification exposed Windows `pnpm.cmd` process resolution; `scripts/run-m13-autopilot.mjs` now invokes the Windows shim through a shell for its fixed literal checks. A dry-run also exposed that task descriptions containing the word “blocked” were counted as blocked states; the runner now reads the explicit status field. `node --check scripts/run-m13-autopilot.mjs` — exit 0. The corrected counter reports 488 total / 15 complete-or-captured / 0 blocked / 473 pending after this task.
- Status: captured. No human review or acceptance claimed. Rollback: revert only the documentation and task-evidence edits above.

## MF-PF-003 — Current release evidence and registry status

- Inspected local HEAD before edits: `fcd2a165ac5517b09944076012837e4dc49b0c3a`.
- Scope: `docs/qa/rc-evidence-and-release-ledger.md`, `docs/backlog/m13-preflight-remediation-tasks.md`, and this ledger.
- Local `package.json` declares `@moonwitness/moonframe@0.1.1`, `private:false`, MIT, and public publish access. These declarations do not prove license authority or publication.
- Registry URL/tag/version/provenance: **not verified**. No registry request or publish attempted. Historical v0.1.0 release notes do not establish a v0.1.1 release.
- `node scripts/validate-contracts.mjs` — exit 0; structural contract checks passed.
- `node scripts/verify-m13-handoff.mjs` — exit 0; handoff integrity passed with existing SFX-consent/playback and missing-LICENSE warnings.
- Status: captured; no human review or acceptance claimed. Rollback: revert the current-release section and the corresponding task/ledger evidence edits only.
